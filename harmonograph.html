  <h2>Building a Harmonograph!</h2>  
<p>
In February 2016, I was invited to help build a harmonograph alongside <a href="http://www.anitachowdry.com">Anita Chowdry</a> 
  which would be used in a
<a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/events/events/bridges-lecture-harmonograph">Bridges lecture</a> given by her and 
John Baez (from <a href="https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/">The n-Category Cafe</a>).
</p>
Here's a video of us building the harmonographs, with the working products at the end:

The diagram Anita provided us, after I had spilled coffee on it and got caught in the freezing rain with it:
