            When improperly designed or deployed, machine learning methods can violate privacy, threaten safety, and 
            perpetuate inequality and injustice. Stakeholders must be able to anticipate such risks and policy questions 
            before they arise, rather than playing catch-up with the technology. To this end, it’s part of the responsibility 
            of researchers, engineers, and developers in the field to help make information about their life-changing research 
            widely available and understandable.
            </p>

            Once there is enough data collected for a given metric or problem, graphs displaying research progress, research 
            techniques, data sets, and so on are generated.

            <p>My role on this project was a co-creator and a software engineer/data hacker. I gathered data from data sources 
            (both manually and in an automated manner), read many academic papers to understand how AI/ML progress was measured 
            and how scoring should be implemented, and implement and designed visualizations.</p>
