            <p>Historically, acquiring and installing SSL certificates has been an expensive, challenging process, leading to many sites only supporting insecure HTTP. As was revealed a few years ago in the Snowden leaks, many governments and ISPs are engaged in unethical mass surveillance, and one way to fight back against this dragnet surveillance has been to encourage the adoption of HTTPS. Certbot is user-friendly and supports many operating systems, server types, and is very customizable, making it a good tool for both beginners and advanced users alike. Certbot (and Let’s Encrypt) have <strong>helped secure at least 47 million domains, and have been a major part of why the Web has gone from 40% to 66% encrypted page loads.</strong> As of November 2017, Certbot is currently the 12th most popular Python project on GitHub, and hasn’t even hit release 1.0 yet.</p>
            
            <p>I primarily contribute to Certbot as a software engineer. My focus has primarily been on <a href="https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/4914">certificate management</a>, making <a href="https://github.com/certbot/certbot/pull/5232">renewal easier</a> for users with non-standard setups, and community outreach.</p>

            <p>As part of my community outreach efforts, I’ve given presentations and led workshops on why HTTPS is useful and using Certbot. I also <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/10/certbot-development-livestream-halloween-edition">livestream</a> Certbot development <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTwuK5TU4qU">on Twitch</a>, in an attempt to (1) encourage open source contributors to contribute to Certbot, and (2) normalize the fact that minorities are welcome as open source contributors on the EFF’s projects and in infosec.</p>

            <p>We have a right to privacy, and I’m proud to be helping defend it through my contributions to open-source software like Certbot.<p>
