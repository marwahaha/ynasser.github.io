            Hello there! I’m Yomna, a Technology Fellow at the EFF 
            (Electronic Frontier Foundation), and a software engineer at Stripe. I have 
            a degree in mathematics from the University of Waterloo.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the EFF, I’ve worked on building tools to encrypt the web, 
          fighting privacy-invasive ads, measuring the progress of AI research, 
          and techniques to overcome cell network surveillance. At Stripe I work on
          building scalable infrastructure using functional programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          My research interests lie at the intersection of technology (especially 
          cryptography!), society, and social justice.

                    My research interests lie at the intersection of technology and society, especially
                    (1) building technology informed by social justice to empower users, (2) using technology
                    to create art that encourages empathy and curiosity. I’m especially passionate about both 
                    theoretical and applied cryptography, as well as art.
